# Linear Algebra Computer

<p>
This is a calculator which executes linear algebra computations on matrices and vectors. Similar to how I was motivated to program my calculus computer,
I was motivated to create this linear algebra computer after having to slave away on arduous matrix computations for my math classes. There were
a lot of computer science majors in my linear algebra class, so naturally, we were interested in how we could automate the computations using our
programming skills.

<h2>Supported Operations:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Gaussian elimination</li>
  <li>Determinants</li>
  <li>Gram-Schmit Process</li>
  <li>Orthogonal projections</li>
  <li>Matrix multiplication</li>
  <li>Matrix transpose</li>
  <li>Matrix addition</li>
</ul>

<p>
This project uses the Python programming language and Django tools to make it web-based. This computer will be integrated into my linear algebra webpage for my Math Museum website

<h2>Important note:</h2> Like calculus, linear algebra is awesome!
