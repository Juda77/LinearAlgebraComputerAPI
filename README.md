# Linear Algebra Computer
Computer which supports the following matrix operations: Gaussian elimination, determinants, Gram-Schmidt Process, orthogonal projections, matrix multiplication, matrix transpose, and matrix addition/subtraction. This project uses the Python programming language and Django tools to make it web-based. This computer will be integrated into my linear algebra webpage for the Math Museum.
