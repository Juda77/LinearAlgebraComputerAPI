# Linear Algebra Computer

<p>
This is a calculator which executes linear algebra computations on matrices and vectors. Similar to how I was motivated to program my calculus computer,
I was motivated to create this linear algebra computer after having to slave away on arduous matrix computations for my math classes. There were
a lot of computer science majors in my linear algebra class, so naturally, we were interested in how we could automate the computations using our
programming skills. Even though there were already available linear algebra computers online, I thought it would be a fun challenge to try to implement
my own computer.

<h2>Supported Operations:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Gaussian elimination</li>
  <li>Determinants</li>
  <li>Gram-Schmit Process</li>
  <li>Orthogonal projections</li>
  <li>Matrix multiplication</li>
  <li>Matrix transpose</li>
  <li>Matrix addition</li>
</ul>

<b>Important note:</b> Like calculus, linear algebra is awesome!
